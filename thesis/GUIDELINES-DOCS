# Simple Guidelines to Write a Scientific Document

## Complexity

 In a scientific text your aim is to describe a possibly complex
 analysis or experiment to a reader that is not necessarly immersed in
 your particular experiment. Avoid terms that are slang. If you want
 to use expression not commonly known introduce them before using them.
 We tend to use inaccurate expressions when we speak among each other
 because we know what we are talking about the reader often does not
 have that context.

 Do not try to go for the nobel price in literature by making complex
 textual constructions. Keep the contents of a sentence simple to make
 sure the reader can follow without going back and forth through your
 sentence. Often it is better to use two phrases rather than
 overloading your sentences. The contents is usually complex enough
 that the additional textual art work does not help. In longer review
 articles it can be appropriate as the reader should also enjoy the
 reading and usually the sentences have simpler messages.

## Choosing the tense

 When describing an analysis it is difficult to keep track of what
 happened when. There is usually no timeline what is done first, next
 and last, and even if there is such a thing it is rarely of relevance
 to the analysis.

 Therefore choose one tense and use it consistently throughout the
 document. The choice is either past tense or present tense. It turns
 out that present tense is usually simpler to use and I prefer it. As
 usual there are exception to the rules. Example: when writing up a
 Run II analysis it is appropriate to refer to the actions performed
 in a similar Run I analysis in past tense, or historic events that
 are refered to need proper use of tenses

## Conditional terms

 The idea of a scientific publication is to describe facts and
 conclude as logical and coherently as possible.

 Therefore the use of conditional clauses should be avoided at all
 cost. Words like may, can, would, could, should, might etc. are to be
 avoided. Usually an analysis follows a strategy and does not need to
 discuss what can, should or would happen if.

## Slang / Colloquial

 dunno, don't and can't          are NOT appropriate for scientific
                                 texts. 
 do not know, do not and cannot  are the correct terms

## Abbreviations

 Before using technical abbreviations introduce them. Abbreviations are
 nice as they can make your text more compact but they can also make
 it unreadable. It is very important to ensure the reader can follow
 and does not need to go back to find out what the abbreviations
 mean. Therefore you might want to introduce abbreviations which you
 use rarely several times in the text. Then you might on the otherhand
 be better off not to use this particular abbreviation.

 Keep in mind: it is bad style to start a phrase with an abbreviation
 or with a number or symbol.

## Figures / Tables / References / Equations

 If you want to refer to figures, tables, references or equations
 which have a number attached to them use capitalized terms like Table
 1 or Equation 2.5 etc. The object should in the text appear on the
 same page as the reference in the text or on the next page, not
 before, as the reeader will wonder what the object refers to.

 Some people like to use abbreviations like: Tab. 1. In case you want
 to use those do it consistently throughout your text. In my mind the
 text is more readable if you write the full word.

 For references there is one additional rule. In case you do not
 explicitely use the reference as part of your text just use the
 number otherwise you have to add the term Reference explicitely.

 Example: The GEANT simulation package [1] is great.
          The GEANT simulation package described in Reference [1] is
          great.

 Every figure/table/reference has to be refered to in the text
 otherwise it is not useful to keep it in the document. It is a good
 policy to make the caption of the figure/table as detailed as it is
 needed for the reader to understand the figure/table without reading
 the complete text. This is very useful as people want to grab figures
 for conferences and need to know all detail about the figure but they
 do not need to go through the text to understand the figure. Typically
 special cut values used to produce the figure should be quoted
 explicitely.

## Sections / Subsections and so on

 Choose a title which is short and characterizes what the section is
 supposed to describe. A section marks the beginning of a new unit and
 it is therefore important that the text without having read the title
 of the section makes sense. As a rule of thumb the contents of the
 section title is usually repeated in some sort in the first sentence.

## Quoting results

 When quoting a measurement please always attach an uncertainty and
 explain what it means. Choose the right number of digits: this means
 an uncertainty should generally have two significant digits and the
 mean value should have the equivalent number of digits.
